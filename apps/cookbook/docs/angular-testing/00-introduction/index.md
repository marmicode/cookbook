# Angular Testing Cookbook

import { useDocsSidebar } from '@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs/client';
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import { ExternalLink } from '@site/src/components/external-link';

This cookbook is the complementary resource to the <ExternalLink href="https://courses.marmicode.io/courses/pragmatic-angular-testing" medium="in-article" content="angular-testing-intro">Pragmatic Angular Testing</ExternalLink> course.

It's for Angular developers who want to build a **pragmatic testing strategy** â€” **in opposition to dogmatic approaches** such as:

- _"your unit-test is not a unit-test"_
- _"let's mock everything"_
- _"let's go full E2E"_
- _"let's target 100% coverage"_

You'll learn how to write tests that are fast, readable, and resilient. You'll escape the cycle of bloated mocks and brittle end-to-end tests that slow down development.

Many teams only realize the cost of skipping these practices after months or years of pain. Lucky you! You found this resource, so you won't have to.
