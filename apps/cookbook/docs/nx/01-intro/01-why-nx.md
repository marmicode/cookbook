# Why Nx?

While Nx is a perfect tool for large organizations and complex products, as surprising as this might sound, **it is also a good fit for less ambitious adventures** like small personal projects.

In fact, even in the opposite extreme, where you would be working alone on a single app, Nx can help you organize your code better and make it more maintainable thanks to:

- **🤖 generators**: why spend time on boilerplate code when Nx can do it for us and provide a state-of-the-art setup?
- **🧳 migrations**: why spend hours catching up with tooling updates when Nx can do it for us?
- **💎 plugins**: why spend minutes on a task that can be done in seconds?
- **⚡️ caching**: why wait for the app to build and deploy when we only update the docs?

We are still wondering when Nx is not a good fit, but we haven't found any yet 🤷🏻‍. If you have, please let us know!
