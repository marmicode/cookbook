# Why Nx?

Nx is your **Progressive Build Companion**.

- **Progressive**: because you can progressively adopt it in your existing projects.
- **Companion**: because it will take care of both boring and complex tasks for you, freeing you to concentrate on delivering value in areas where you excel.

Here is just a glimpse of the Nx features that will help you; starting today:

- **🪄 Generators**: Why spend time on boilerplate code when Nx can do it for us and provide a state-of-the-art setup?
- **🧳 Migrations**: Why spend hours catching up with tooling updates when Nx can do it for us?
- **💎 Plugins**: Why spend minutes on a task that can be done in seconds?
- **⚡️ Caching & Dependency Graph**: Why wait for the app to build and deploy when we only update the docs?
- **🤖 Agents**: Why wait or waste time maintaining complex CI workflows, when [Nx Cloud](https://nx.app/) can orchestrate and parallelize everything for you without hassle?
- **🚦 Boundaries**: Why keep catching architecture style mistakes late and manually when Nx can enforce your architecture for you?

While Nx is a **perfect tool for large organizations and complex products**, as surprising as this might sound, **it is also a good fit for less ambitious adventures** like small personal projects. In fact, even in the opposite extreme, where you would be working alone on a single app, Nx can help you organize your code better and make it more maintainable.

We are still wondering when Nx is **not** a good fit, but we haven't found any yet 🤷🏻‍. If you have, please let us know!
