import { MegaQuote } from '@site/src/components/mega-quote';

One of the main concepts in Angular is that your application is split into a tree of components. Each component represents a reusable piece of the UI that:

- can contain other components â€” its children,
- communicates with its children through a defined contract,
- exposes a contract to its parent,
- keeps its state isolated from other components.

The main advantages of components are:

- **Reusability** â€” components are designed to be reusable.
- **Isolation** â€” components keep their implementation isolated from other components.
- **Separation of Concerns** â€” each component has a specific role and delegates work to other components.
- **Testability** â€” components help narrowing down tests.

All these elements are meant to make apps easier to maintain.

    A Component controls a patch of screen real estate that we could call a
    view, and declares reusable UI building blocks for an application.

Note that well crafted components are like a well organized fridge and kitchen, they will help you ship faster.

## Example

Let's take our cooking app Whiskmate.

We can imagine the following component hierarchy:

```mermaid
graph TD
subgraph RecipeSearch
    direction LR

    subgraph RecipePreview
        RecipeAddButton
    end

    subgraph RecipeFilter
        direction TB
        MyInput
        MyButton
    end
end

```
