# Angular Core Cookbook

import { useDocsSidebar } from '@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs/client';
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

This Angular Core cookbook distills the essential knowledge for building apps that scale and survive Angular migrations. It cuts through the noise â€” no experimental APIs _(with a few thoroughly explained exceptions)_, no hype. Just the knowledge that matters.
You'll also find **many practices that developers often wish they had adopted from day one**.

<DocCardList items={useDocsSidebar().items.slice(1)}/>
